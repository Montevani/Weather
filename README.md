# Weather
A 7 lines long code in python that grabs the current weather from openweathermap.org for a specified city and prints it on the screen. 
You could use that data in a really fancy way but I'm not bothering with that right now. 
My main goal was to just test a few things with Pretty Print and give an exercise from freeCodeCamp a try.
